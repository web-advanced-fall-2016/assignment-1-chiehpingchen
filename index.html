<a id="assignment-specification" class="anchor" href="#assignment-specification" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Assignment Specification</h2>

<p>Each student should develop one user interface element ( What are UI elements? See <a href="http://semantic-ui.com/modules/search.html">here</a>! ). You need to choose <strong>one</strong> of the following four options to develop as for your assignment. Go to each of their readme pages to find out about their requirements.</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/web-advanced-fall-2016/assignment-1-spec/blob/master/README-SLIDER.md"><strong>A Slider/Carousel Element</strong></a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/web-advanced-fall-2016/assignment-1-spec/blob/master/README-ACCORDION.md"><strong>An Accordion Element</strong></a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/web-advanced-fall-2016/assignment-1-spec/blob/master/README-MODAL.md"><strong>A Modal Element</strong></a></li>
<li>
<a href="https://github.com/web-advanced-fall-2016/assignment-1-spec/blob/master/README-SEARCH-SUGGESTION-DROPDOWN.md"><strong>A Search Field Element With Dropdown for Suggestions From Static Data</strong></a> (long name! sorry! it's simple tho)</li>
</ul>

<p>If you were interested in developing other UI elements other than these four options, let me know and we'll make that work.</p>

<h3>
<a id="bonus-points" class="anchor" href="#bonus-points" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>BONUS POINTS</h3>

<ul>
<li>Each option has its own bonus requirements.</li>
<li>If you put together a demo page for your assignment when you are done developing it (something like <a href="https://samantehrani.github.io/simple-carousel/"><strong>THIS</strong></a>) it'll be a big bonus. It's just good presentation of your work and is great for own. Look here for <a href="https://github.com/web-advanced-fall-2016/class-wiki/wiki/Create-a-GitHub-Project-Page-for-project's-demo">how to do so</a>.</li>
<li>Make it look BEAUTIFUL</li>
</ul>

<h2>
<a id="submission-details" class="anchor" href="#submission-details" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Submission Details</h2>

<p>All the submission must be done through github to our class organization <a href="https://github.com/web-advanced-fall-2016">@web-advanced-fall-2016</a>. The assignment will be accomodated and distributed using <a href="https://classroom.github.com/">GitHub Classroom</a>. GitHub classroom will automatically create a repository in our organization for each student and will grant administrative rights of that repository to that student.<br>
All students <strong>MUST</strong> visit this url: <a href="https://classroom.github.com/assignment-invitations/2016637b1c5f5a01c2ef6f041bba4bb5">Confirmation Link</a>. There you will be asked to accept and confirm the reception of the First Assignment and consequently a repository will be automatically created for you under our oranization. The name of your repository will follow the following pattern: <code>assignment-1-${your GitHub username}</code>.</p>

<p>Your new repository will start looking exactly like the current repository<code>assignment-1-spec</code>. So there will be four versions of README.md under the names of: <code>README-SLIDER.md</code>, <code>README-ACCORDION.md</code>, <code>README-MODAL.md</code>, <code>README-SEARCH-SUGGESTION-DROPDOWN.md</code>. Exactly like here now!<br>
In your own new assignment respository <code>https://github.com/web-advanced-fall-2016/assignment-1-${your username}</code>, go on and delete README.md and replace it with the readme of your choice.    </p>

<h4>
<a id="example" class="anchor" href="#example" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Example</h4>

<p>Just to show the what procedure is like, I created a new github account for an imaginary student (for test): his name is "Sample Student". This is his github profile link: <a href="https://github.com/sample-student">https://github.com/sample-student</a>. (while logged in as "Sample Student") Clicked on the aforementioned confirmation link. GitHub classroom automatically created this repository for him : <a href="https://github.com/web-advanced-fall-2016/assignment-1-sample-student">https://github.com/web-advanced-fall-2016/assignment-1-sample-student</a>. Then let's assume that "Sample Student" picked to develop <code>Accordion</code>. So, he removed all of the readme files except the one for accordion and added his information to it.    </p>
